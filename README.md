# JaRoet Outliner

This outliner is made from the need for a **Workflowy**, **Dynalist** or **Logseq** alternative that does not 
require any installation to use and that stores the information locally. Without any dependency on cloud or web. 

Google's AIstudio is used for the creation of this software as I myself lack any developer-skills. But I know how 
to define/write-up features and I can test the results. 

I am fairly happy with the way this works. As I do this as a side-project in my evening spare time, I will take small steps. Let me know in the discussions if you want certain features included.
